### About

My research focuses on investigating spatiotemporal variations in fields of ecology, environment, and human-environment interactions. Most of my work involve using geographic information sciences and remote sensing techniques for geospatial analyses. 

### Education

- Ph.D. student, Department of Geography and the Environment, University of Texas at Austin (2021-present)
- M.Sc. in Conservation Ecology & Geospatial Data Science, School for Environment and Sustainability, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (2018-2020)
- B.Sc. in Environmental Science, Beijing Normal University–Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (2014-2018)

### Current Research 
- Project: Networked PalYnology Models of Pollen and Human Systems (NYMPHS)
  - Funding: Department of Defense Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI)
  - Developing a framework for geographic attribution using species distribution models in forensic palynology based on biotic, abiotic, movement, social (BAMS) factors.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewhywong/andrewhywong.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/andrewhywong/andrewhywong.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
