### About

I am a second year Doctoral student at the University of Texas at Austin under the supervision of Dr. <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14133046">Jennifer A. Miller</a>. I focus on investigating spatiotemporal variations in fields of ecology, environment, and human-environment interactions using geographic information sciences and remote sensing techniques. 

### Education

- Ph.D. student, Department of Geography and the Environment, University of Texas at Austin (2021-present)
- M.Sc. in Conservation Ecology & Geospatial Data Science, School for Environment and Sustainability, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor (2018-2020)
- B.Sc. in Environmental Science, Beijing Normal Universityâ€“Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (2014-2018)

### Current Research 
- Project: Networked PalYnology Models of Pollen and Human Systems (NYMPHS)
  - Funding: Department of Defense Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI)
  - Developing a framework for geographic attribution using species distribution models in forensic palynology based on biotic, abiotic, movement, social (BAMS) factors.
