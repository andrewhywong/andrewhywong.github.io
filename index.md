### About

I'm interested in investigating spatiotemporal variations in ecological and environmental fields. My current work involves species distribution models and geocomputation. 
I was a Research Associate at the University of Michigan and worked with high/very high resolution remote sensing data for various geospatial analyses.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/andrewhywong/andrewhywong.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
